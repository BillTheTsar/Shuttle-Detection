# Shuttle-Detection
An independent computer vision project culminating in a system capable of tracking a badminton shuttle from match footage. With TensorRT, the system achieves super real-time speeds of 86 FPS. Once improved with a larger dataset, the project will become the foundation for badminton analytics and even shot prediction.
